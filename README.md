# Dotfiles

This project was made to make it easy to apply my personal configuration on a new computer.
The scrip check_for_updates.sh will periodically ask to update the system, so that stuff is up to date.

## To install

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/bjarlestam/dotfiles.git
    ./setup.sh
